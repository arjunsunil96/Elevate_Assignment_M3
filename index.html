                While you are crossing the streets of any place and gazing
                around the city, what attracts your eyes? Any idea? It is the
                livelihood and front elevating designs of the shops,
                restaurants, malls or anything which can grab the attention just
                by looks. That is how it works on the pages, websites on the
                internet.
              </p>
              <p>
                When researching any topic on the internet, one should look for
                websites that are user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing, and
                easy to navigate. What lies behind the attractive webpages and
                interactive features we access through web browsers is known as
                Front-end Development. This involves creating user interfaces
                that users can interact with and view on a web application.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the greatest obstacles faced by front-end developers is
                staying up-to-date on the tools and processes for creating the
                user-facing side of websites, which require continuous
                monitoring of the industry's developments.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you're confused about what front-end technology to choose,
                don't worry! We've compiled a list of the top 10 technologies
                you should be aware of in 2023. To make the best selection, take
                some time to consider the features of each technology and to
                brainstorm your options.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before diving into the details of front-end technologies, it is
                important to understand what front-end development is.

              What is Front-End Development?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Have you ever wondered how websites are created? The clicks of
              buttons, slides of images, carousels, loading symbols, and
              navigations are all examples of front-end development, which is
              what the user can actually see on the pages. This type of
              development allows users to become engaged with the website and
              all the features it offers. To give the website an attractive
              look, action and design are created through the three main
              front-end technologies: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS
              (Cascading Style Sheet), and JS (JavaScript).

              website. They are key tools for enhancing the way users interact

                ReactJS, commonly known as React, is a prominent open-source,
                JavaScript-based front-end library developed and maintained by
                Facebook. It provides a dynamic and interactive user experience
                to improve UI/UX design, while only dealing with the view layer.
                React is utilized in various Facebook products, such as
                Instagram and WhatsApp, and can be used with frameworks, like
                Next.js, to create single-page, mobile, or server-side
                applications. Additionally, code can be broken down into smaller
                pieces, which makes debugging processes more efficient.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over 220,000 websites have adopted React as their platform of
                choice. Some of the most prominent companies utilizing this
                framework are Apple, PayPal, BBC, Dropbox, Reddit, and Netflix.

              <ul>
                <li class="pb-3 pt-3">
                  <strong>Virtual DOM:</strong> React JS uses a virtual
                  representation of the real DOM, which allows it to update only
                  the parts of the UI that have changed, instead of re-rendering
                  the whole UI. This improves the performance and efficiency of
                  the web application.
                </li>
                <li class="pb-3">
                  <strong>JSX:</strong> JSX is a syntax extension that allows us
                  to write HTML-like code in JavaScript. It makes the code more
                  readable and easier to write. JSX is not mandatory, but it is
                  recommended to use it with React JS. JSX is compiled into
                  JavaScript by a tool called Babel.
                </li>
                <li class="pb-3">
                  <strong>React Native:</strong> React Native is a framework
                  that allows us to use React JS to create native mobile
                  applications for Android and iOS platforms. It uses the same
                  components and concepts as React JS, but renders them using
                  native UI elements. React Native enables us to write
                  cross-platform mobile applications with a native look and
                  feel.
                </li>
                <li class="pb-3">
                  <strong>One-way data binding:</strong> React JS follows a
                  one-way data flow, which means that the data is passed from
                  the parent components to the child components as properties
                  (props). The child components cannot modify the props, but
                  they can communicate with the parent components through
                  callback functions. This makes the data flow more predictable
                  and easier to debug.
                </li>
                <li class="pb-3">
                  <strong>Components:</strong> React JS is based on a
                  component-based architecture, which means that the UI is
                  divided into reusable pieces of code called components. Each
                  component has its own state, logic, and presentation.
                  Components can be nested inside other components to create
                  complex UIs. Components make the code more modular and
                  maintainable.
                </li>
                <li class="pb-3">
                  <strong>Simplicity:</strong> React JS is simple to learn and
                  use, especially if you are familiar with HTML and JavaScript.
                  It has a minimalistic and intuitive syntax, and a clear and
                  concise documentation. It also has a large and active
                  community that provides support and resources.
                </li>
                <li class="pb-3">
                  <strong>Performance:</strong> React JS is known for its high
                  performance and fast rendering. It uses various techniques and
                  optimizations, such as virtual DOM, diffing algorithm,
                  batching updates, and hooks, to ensure that the web
                  application runs smoothly and efficiently

              <p>
                Angular.js (also known as Angular or AngularJS) is a
                JavaScript-based open-source web application framework that is
                used to create single-page web applications. Angular.js is used
                to enhance and simplify web application development, while
                providing developers with a robust tool set. It is based on the
                Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern and is maintained by
                Google.
              </p>
              <p>
                Angular.js helps developers create dynamic applications with
                data binding, templates, and routing. With its two-way data
                binding, developers only need to write the model and the view
                part of the software application without the need to worry about
                synchronizing data between the view and model layers.
                Additionally, templates give developers the ability to quickly
                create user-friendly interfaces with minimal coding. Finally,
                the routing system allows the application to navigate between
                different views in an organized way.

                <li class="pb-3 pt-3">
                  <strong>MVC Architecture:</strong> Angular JS follows the
                  Model-View-Controller pattern, which separates the application
                  logic, data, and presentation. This makes the code more
                  organized, modular, and testable.

                <li class="pb-3">
                  <strong>Data Binding:</strong> Angular JS supports two-way
                  data binding, which means that any changes in the model are
                  automatically reflected in the view, and vice versa. This
                  eliminates the need for manual DOM manipulation and
                  synchronization.
                </li>
                <li class="pb-3">
                  <strong>Directives:</strong> Angular JS allows us to create
                  custom HTML attributes and elements, called directives, that
                  can extend the functionality of the HTML. Directives can be
                  used to create reusable components, add behaviors, and
                  manipulate the DOM.
                </li>
                <li class="pb-3">
                  <strong>Dependency Injection:</strong> Angular JS supports
                  dependency injection, which is a technique that allows us to
                  inject objects or services into other objects or services,
                  without creating them explicitly. This makes the code more
                  flexible, maintainable, and testable.

                <li class="pb-3">
                  <strong>Routing:</strong> Angular JS provides a built-in
                  routing service, called ngRoute, that enables us to create
                  single-page applications with multiple views and controllers.
                  Routing allows us to switch between different views based on
                  the URL, without reloading the page.

                <li class="pb-3">
                  <strong>Services:</strong> Angular JS provides various
                  built-in services, such as $http, $location, $timeout,
                  $interval, etc., that can be used to perform common tasks and
                  communicate with the backend. We can also create our own
                  custom services and inject them into other components using
                  dependency injection.
                </li>
                <li class="pb-3">
                  <strong>Filters:</strong> Angular JS provides various built-in
                  filters, such as uppercase, lowercase, date, currency, etc.,
                  that can be used to format and transform the data in the view.
                  We can also create our own custom filters and use them with
                  the pipe (|) operator.

                <em>Evan You</em> created the well-known JavaScript framework
                'Vue.js' to develop interactive User Interfaces (UIs) and
                Single-page Applications (SPAs). Its usage for the production of
                lightweight and flexible interactive UI components is renowned
                among JavaScript frameworks. Vue.js offers an effective way to
                implement the MVVM (Model View-View Model) model architecture
                pattern due to its lightweight nature.
              </p>
              <p>
                For front-end development, Vue.js is ideal because it requires
                HTML and CSS knowledge and its core library is solely dedicated
                to the view layer. It can be easily incorporated into bigger
                projects without any issues or complications. Vue.js is used to

              <p>
                Meteor is a free, open-source, full-stack JavaScript framework
                that is built using Node.js. Since its inception in 2011, it has
                earned a reputation as an ideal, easy-to-use solution for rapid
                prototyping and developing cross-platform code (iOS, Web,
                Android). The array of packages provided, the node.js and
                MongoDB foundation it relies on, and the code flexibility it
                offers make Meteor an excellent tool for building robust, secure
                real-time web applications as well as handling everything from
                the browser applications to a database or server.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is claimed that Meteor can be used for both the front-end and
                back-end development of mobile, web and desktop applications.
                Yet, building the entire application using only Meteor for
                multiple platforms might not be the most rational move. A few of
